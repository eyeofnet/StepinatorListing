# StepinatorListing
Provides a code listing plugin for the Stepinator tool in [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/). This project is built using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) and the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse (see the file `GhidraDev_README.html` inside the Ghidra installation directory).

# Cloning the Repository
The Eclipse project will not build until you supply it with a valid .classpath file in the top StepinatorListing directory. We suggest creating an empty Ghidra plugin project and copying the .classpath file from that project to the StepinatorListing directory.
